The user of the application can defined :

* the number of group
* the smpt server used
* the email contents

## Installation

* Install Java (OpenJDK or Oracle) and Apache Maven.
* Clone the repository and head to the config directory
    * **config.smtp.txt** is the file where you can define the number of groups, the smtp server address and port.
    * **messages.utf8.txt** is the file that contains the Subjects and contents of the mails you want to send.
    The format is as follows:
    ```
    Subject: [your subject here]
    
    [your message here]
    
    ===
    ```
    * **victims.txt** is the file where you write the list of all email addresses that you wish to use in your prank.
* Once you have edited or completed all the previous files, open a terminal and head to the project directory.
* Compile the project with the following command:
```
mvn clean package
```
* Run it with
```
$ java -jar target/SMTP_server_prank-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Youn can also set up a test environement by using a mock SMTP server on your own computer:

* MockMock is a mock SMTP server: https://github.com/tweakers-dev/MockMock
* Open a teminal in the folder that contains the **jar** file and run:
```
$ java -jar MockMock.jar -p xxxx -Ä¥ yyyy
```

Where:

* ```-p xxxx``` stands for the local port for the SMTP server, default is 25.
* ```-h yyyy``` stands for the port used by the web interface, default is 8282.

* Connect to the http interface by browsing to 
```

```

## Implementation

The project is divided in 4 packages :

* **mail** that contains the $JAVA$ files related to a mail, a group or a person.
* **parsers** that contains the $JAVA$ files that parse the files in the **config** directory.
* **prank** that contains the prank generator file (main program).
